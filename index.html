This gym has it all. Very friendly staff and a great sense of community between everyone training there. I always have a great experience there.”

            “Fitness Journey has always been more than a gym. It's become such a strong and welcoming community filled with amazing people old and new. I used to train in my sitting room as I felt way too intimidated to go to an actual gym but when I tried out FJ, I was welcomed in straight away and felt very at ease and motivated. Best Irish gym by far!!!”
